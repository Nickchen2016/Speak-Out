# Speak-Out

** Version 1.0 **

## Why?

- Did you ever feel that you can absorb more information by listening someone's speaking than read by yourself?

- Did you ever struggle to copy some unknown words on the browser & paste in another tab to figure out its meaning?

## Description

Speak-Out is a small tool that fixs those questions above & helps you to have a smoother 🏄‍♀️🏄🏼 experience.


## How To Use?

Since it is a Chrome Extension. I need you to have a Google Chrome 1st.

No npm install require, if you want to check the code. Just download it & go to your Chrome Broswer.

In Chrome Broswer--Window--Extensions--Load Unpacked--locate the download file--Select--Enjoy!🍻
